ADAM App Module Prototyping
The ADAM app module prototyping process is about coming up with visual and interactive 
application user interface (UI) as well as user experience (UX) representations. This is very 
important because during this phase the concept designs will be turned to physical designs hence 
allowing stakeholders to see how the application functions and its flow before the actual creation 
process begins. Prototyping involves user feedback gathering for the design team to iterate on 
designs so that the final product is. Before development begins actual functionality, it enables 
stakeholders visualize logic behind its functionality at before development begins Ensuring a 
product’s success starts from its design stage.
